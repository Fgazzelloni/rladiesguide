## Booking a slot

### Book with Calendly

You can see which time slots are available and book any of them through
Calendly (link above). After you book a meeting time, you will receive
an email with the Zoom link. We've set the availability to 24/7. 

### Announce the event on Meetup

* [Hosting an online event on Meetup ](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040609112)
* [Meetup event policies and the coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041040931)

### A slot for what?

Feel free to book a slot for any type of R-Ladies events: talk/tutorial but also co-working/hangout, networking, code workshop, co-watching past conference talks...

## Running a meeting

To let
you run your meetups as independently as possible, we have set it up the
following way:

:information_desk_person: You will be able to be the Host of the
meeting with the associated privileges/controls. As the Host you can
also make co-organizers and presenters Co-Hosts of the meeting.

:key: We will give you the Zoom **Host Key**
with which you can make yourself the Host without anybody of us needing
to be online to make you the Host. We will post the Host Key once a
month in the \#online\_meetup channel on the R-Ladies Organizer Slack.

:clock2: We won't be able to be online to start
the meeting for you (because of timezones) so we have enabled "join
before host" and disabled the waiting room. To minimise the likelihood
of trolls crashing the meeting before you join and make yourself the
Host, we suggest to add a 15-minute buffer at the start of your meeting
to the calendly booking, e.g., book for 5:45pm and tell your meetup
participants that it starts at 6pm. **Please be punctual so that the
Host is there to manage the meetup before others show up.**

You can claim the Host role after you joined the meeting by clicking on
participants and then on "claim host" in the right-hand corner. You will
need to enter the host key which you'll get from us prior to the
meetup.

### How to claim Host controls using the Host Key

1.  Click on the Zoom meeting URL and join the meeting

2.  Once you're in the meeting, click on the 'Participants' list to bring up the list below.
At the very bottom you should see some buttons -- click on the 'Claim Host' button.

3.  Type in the Host key (get the key from the \#online\_meetup channel on the R-Ladies Organizer Slack & don't share it)

### Tips for Running the Zoom meeting

:eyes: After becoming Host, we suggest that you:

-   Enable the waiting room.

-   Admit your co-organisers (if they are still in the waiting room) and
 make them co-host so that they can manage bad actors with you if
 necessary. **Being several to run an online meeting makes things easier (e.g. one organizer can keep an eye on the chat).**

-   Do the same for your presenter so that they can share their screen
    even if regular participants cannot.

We have set the meeting options to prevent trolling as best as possible
(e.g., *participants are muted on entry, participants who have been
removed from the meeting can't rejoin, and we've disabled chat, file
transfers, screen sharing for participants, and also virtual
backgrounds*). With the latest version of the zoom client, the host has
an extra security control menu where they can adapt a lot of these
settings during the meeting (e.g., *turning on/off the waiting room,
chat, and screen sharing*).

:zombie: If you do have to deal with trolls:

-   Mute everyone and don't let them unmute (uncheck "allow participants
    to unmute themselves" when muting all).

-   Remove the participant (hover your mouse over their name, click
    "more" and click "remove").

-   Lock the meeting so no one can come in (select "more" under
    participants and "lock meeting").

Lastly, the link to book the online meetup is **not to be shared
publicly** as it's only intended for organisers.

### Zoom and YouTube

One may also use the zoom recording option if your speaker is up for that. 
It is a great way to get content available to more people. 
We can host this on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDgj5-mFohWZ5irWSFMFcng).

We also, through that channel, have the opportunity to do live streaming, if anyone wants to give that a go. 
Athanasia Monika Mowinckel will be administering the YouTube channel and activity, so if you have recordings you want on YT or want to try live streaming, let her know and she’ll get that happening for you! 
If you are doing live streaming, she will give you temporary user access to the R-Ladies YT channel so you can run it at your leisure. 

[Zoom meeting/webinar simultaneously with YT livestream, Zoom docs](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360028478292-Streaming-a-Meeting-or-Webinar-on-YouTube-Live)

You can also do your YouTube livestream as unlisted and only share the link with the people you want to attend. 
If they share the link others can see the livestream, 
but the stream won't be publicly listed and there won't be notifications sent to channel subscribers.
