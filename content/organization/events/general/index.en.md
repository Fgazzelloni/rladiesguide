This document is in progress.
In the meantime, you can ask other organizers for tips in the \#organisers slack channel.

### Launch Event

Different ideas:

* Kickoff/Meet & Greet: Present your vision/idea for the meetup, invite others to help
  organise.
* Lightning talks: Short talks of 5 minutes on a range of topics. This format usually
  also has a low barrier to participate.
* Survey: Some chapters have set up an online questionnaire before their first meeting to
  find out what people were looking for in the meetup. Here are examples from
  [Paris](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPHTc1CuMHFmisaR53kM0G5iReXZfZH6CcKV6wsX0Gww5m3Q/viewform?c=0&w=1), [Madrid](https://chucheria.typeform.com/to/dGf4OR), [Tbilisi](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedln6IeqdQXFRAm7PI0CxvRZXmFY74iG_wyLc-cuBy8pxnPw/viewform), [Oslo](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePbvOiSGDPK8z7Eo0beK7P1BCrip7xUZzo_mcUidoi4lFMgQ/viewform), [Los Angeles](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEePUCFgkiRWa2nL1ECBntndw4Z2U7hvIVb3ao2IsriWFkag/viewform).
* Making your group/event known: you can reach out to some other meetups in the area which
  might have overlapping audiences (e.g., data science meetup and R user groups) and
  universities (e.g., statistics departments).
* Finding co-organisers: Some chapters have found their organising team at the launch
  event, others have included a question on who would be interested in organising in the
  initial survey.

### (Further) Events

* Deciding on desired/feasible frequency of events (once a month, once every few months?)
* Appropriate event formats depending on profile of the local community. More academic, more industry? Talks, tutorials, lightning talks, drop-in sessions, socials? Working through online courses together? 
* How to find venues to host meetups (for free!)
* How to find speakers
* Hot to find material: online courses, material developed by other R-Ladies (should in
  future go on the [GitHub organisation](http://github.com/rladies))
* How to find sponsors for refreshments
* Event registration, management and data collection
    * How to use Eventbrite to manage meetup attendance & data collection (or any
      equivalent local available platforms) - meetup is quite limited for managing events
    * Set up Google Analytics on your meetup to collect data
    * _How to create R-Ladies Database_
* Advertising, Publicity and Event Discovery: Twitter, LinkedIn, Eventbrite etc. (i.e.,
  popular marketing channels and platforms in your area);  _Database (once developed!)_
* Live streaming or recording of an event ([instructions](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Streaming-&-recording-of-meetups))
