If you are an R-Ladies organizer and have further questions, please ask them in an issue.

## Planning events

*  Organise the year (or, say, semester) in advance. Even if you change your plan in the middle is always good to know what to expect.

* Find speakers at least two months before the talk. Even if it is a 5 minutes talk, it will give you peace of mind and time for people to prepare their talk.

* To find ideas for topics, have a look at [other R-Ladies groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies/) or at conference programs. Also ask your meetup members for ideas and wishes.

### Launch Event

Different ideas:

* Kickoff/Meet & Greet: Present your vision/idea for the meetup, invite others to help
  organise.
* Lightning talks: Short talks of 5 minutes on a range of topics. This format usually
  also has a low barrier to participate.
* Survey: Some chapters have set up an online questionnaire before their first meeting to
  find out what people were looking for in the meetup. Here are examples from
  [Paris](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPHTc1CuMHFmisaR53kM0G5iReXZfZH6CcKV6wsX0Gww5m3Q/viewform?c=0&w=1), [Madrid](https://chucheria.typeform.com/to/dGf4OR), [Tbilisi](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedln6IeqdQXFRAm7PI0CxvRZXmFY74iG_wyLc-cuBy8pxnPw/viewform), [Oslo](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePbvOiSGDPK8z7Eo0beK7P1BCrip7xUZzo_mcUidoi4lFMgQ/viewform), [Los Angeles](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEePUCFgkiRWa2nL1ECBntndw4Z2U7hvIVb3ao2IsriWFkag/viewform).
* Making your group/event known: you can reach out to some other meetups in the area which
  might have overlapping audiences (e.g., data science meetup and R user groups) and
  universities (e.g., statistics departments).
* Finding co-organisers: Some chapters have found their organising team at the launch
  event, others have included a question on who would be interested in organising in the
  initial survey.
  
## Where to hold events?

This is a paragraph for when we all can have events in-person again.

To find a good space for your event, think of spaces you know (maybe a room at work, a room that the city lets local groups use, etc.), ask other local meetups.

Please keep accessibility in mind: can everyone access your meetup space? E.g. you don't want to exclude people who use wheelchairs! If the space you are holding the event at does not clearly list accessibility on their website, check with them, and list the information on your event description (potential attendees should not have to ask).
  
## Events RSVP

Note that some people might RSVP to an event and not attend, it's actually quite common.
You will however need to set a maximal number of participants based on the physical capabilities of the room you organize the event it, or based on the online platform you use.

## During events

* Always remember that there is a code of conduct and you are not afraid to use it! Minorities will feel at home if there's someone there to guard their safe space. Sometimes it can be very intimidating to tell someone to shut up or that they are not welcome but the code of conduct actually gives you the authority to do it without being a personal issue.

## What is a successful event?

A successful event does not need to have a huge turnout. 
Of course you want a few people to attend to make your efforts and the speaker's efforts worthwhile, but there does not need to be dozens of participants.
Also, some events, the first, or some random events, might have a lower turnout than expected and that's ok.
