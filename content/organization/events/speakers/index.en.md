## How to recruit speakers

* Regularly tell meetup attendees that you are looking for speakers.

* Suggest topics to members of your chapter; e.g. if you notice someone got started with ggplot2 or wrote their own package, suggest they talk about that.

* Lightning talks events can be a way to invite new speakers since they can prepare a short talk. Example [Call for Proposals by R-Ladies NYC](https://www.rladiesnyc.org/post/lightning-talk-submissions-request/).

* You might be able to reach out to potential speakers outside of your chapter thanks to meetups being online / sponsor funding for travel.

* Remember the [rules about Prioritization of Underrepresented/Minority Genders](/about/mission/#r-ladies-rules--guidelines).
