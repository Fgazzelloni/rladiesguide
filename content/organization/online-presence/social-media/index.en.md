> We love to raise our voices about the R-ladies community 

## Should my chapter participate in social media?

* Social media accounts are a commitment. However there are many benefits that come from creating an local R-Ladies Chapter account.
* R-Ladies dominant social media channel is Twitter. We have a global Twitter account ([RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal)), and most R-Ladies chapters have their own Twitter account (e.g., [RLadiesLondon](https://twitter.com/RLadiesLondon)).

## What are the benefits of using social media?

* Raising the voices of R-Ladies.
* For chapter organisers and R-Ladies within the group, new opportunities and networks both locally and globally are shared and communicated. 
* Find R-Ladies around the world. 
* Find R content using \#stats. 
* Find R-Ladies content using \#rladies</u>.

## Where to find R content

* \#rstats & \#rladies hashtag on Twitter.
* [R weekly newsletter](https://rweekly.org/)
* [Other sources](https://masalmon.eu/2019/01/25/uptodate/)

## Twitter


#### Twitter

* Local Twitter handle (optional, but encouraged!) should also use the @RLadiesLocation format, for example: [@RLadiesSF](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSF) and [@RLadiesLondon](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSF), with the same name as the meetup.com group name (above). If the city name is too long for a Twitter handle, you can use an abbreviation such as [@RLadiesCDMX](https://twitter.com/RLadiesCDMX).  The "name" on the account should be "R-Ladies Location". (e.g. [@RLadiesLondon](https://twitter.com/RLadiesLondon) and "R-Ladies London").
* Please use your chapter R-Ladies email address (e.g. yourcity@rladies.org) to set up Twitter and other social media accounts rather than a personal email address. 
* Don't forget to add the [R-Ladies logo and the purple color](/organization/brand/). 
* You can find some inspiration here: https://twitter.com/gdequeiroz/lists/rladies-chapters/members 
* [General introduction to Twitter for R users](https://www.t4rstats.com/)

## Social media use guidelines and code of conduct:

* The chapter accounts should be used to promote:

    + The work (e.g. open source projects, blog posts, academic research) of individual R-Ladies.
    + R-Ladies events and announcements for your chapter; or online R-Ladies events.
    + Tutorials or R-related resources that you think are really great even if they’re not written by an R-Lady.
* Please tag all your R-Ladies related tweets with the #rladies hashtag. This makes them searchable and more visible.
* On tagging \@RLadiesGlobal: please do that if you are referring to the global organisation. If you want to refer to R-Ladies in general, please use the hashtag. Otherwise you make [notifications of the global account harder to follow](/comm/twitter/).
* Please add further hashtags to \#rladies in the following situations:
    + If your chapter has a visitor from another chapter, please take a photo and share
it on Twitter using the hashtag,  \#rladiesvisits.
    + If you are tweeting about R-Ladies in Latin America, please consider adding \#RLadiesLatAm.
* We encourage posting photos from events as long as you got the ok of participants! (see example text in [Suggested Meetup alignment](/organization/brand/))
* We love images, animated gifs and emojis as a form of expression! :smile_cat:
* When using images and gifs make sure to use [alternative text for accessibility](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions)!
* Feel free to retweet posts by others that promote R-Ladies’ work and events as well.
* Do not use your chapter account as a personal account: no personal tweets or massive self-promotion
    + When tweeting, do not use the word “I”, always use “we”
    + It’s okay to promote the #rstats related work/projects of R-Ladies, including yourself, just don’t over-do it and don’t promote work that’s not directly related to R or R-Ladies.
    + No selfies (we encourage group pictures instead).
* Do not make political statements with your chapter account. Please use your personal Twitter for political speech.
    + Feminist or women-in-tech related topics are okay, but please stay away from traditional politics, as that can be divisive to the community and R-Ladies is a non-partisan organization.
* Do not promote products or any other commercial offerings.
    + Promoting open source R projects that are backed by a company (e.g., RStudio) is okay.
    + Thanking a meetup host/sponsor for their support is okay.
    + Only promote a book if its online version is freely available.
* Always speak positively about people’s work, e.g., “Tidyverse is awesome!” instead of “Tidyverse is better than base R!”
