We do not want you to spend your personal money on your local chapter!

## Local sponsors

If you find a local sponsors, at the moment since there is no formal structure for receiving funds, it is best if the sponsor pays directly for a need of your chapter, like food at the next event.

There is the option of paying from your own pocket and have the sponsor reimburse you but that is riskier.

We are piloting using [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) -- the results of the pilot are not in yet. 

## Expenses reimbursed by the globlal organization

Subject to **availability of funding and after discussion with the finance team**, expenses can be reimbursed.

### What expenses can I get reimbursed?

If you need money to buy food/drinks for your event, we suggest to get a sponsor or to apply for a grant through the [R User Group support program](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program) (grants start from $150).

If you cannot get an sponsor/grant and/or wish to discuss what type of expenses could be covered by the R-Ladies organisation, please contact the **finance team** (`finance@rladies.org`) **before making any expense**.

### How to submit expenses

If the finance team agrees on covering you expenses, please follow the steps below:

1. Complete the [R Consortium Expense Reimbursement form](R_Consortium_Expense_Reimbursement_Template.xls) filling in dates and descriptions of the expenses. **Remember to add to the expenses any international transaction fees to transfer USD to your account (ask your bank for more details)**. Sign and date the form.

2. If you reside in the US, you will get a check payment (remember to specify your home address in the reimbursement form). If you reside outside the US, please fill in the [Wire Form](LF_Wire_Instructions.pdf) as the payment will be made via wire transfer (remember to specify the IBAN in your bank account details).

3. Create 1 pdf file containing: the reimbursement form, wire form (if applicable) and all the receipts. Name the file <YYYYMMDD_SURNAMENAME.pdf>, where YYYYMMDD is the date you submit of your expenses.

4. Send the pdf to the **finance team** (`finance@rladies.org`)

Please remember:

- to use an email address you check regularly as we might need extra information from you;
- to provide a receipt for each item you wish to get reimbursed;
- lastly, let us know if you wish to get an invite to the private slack-channel 'expenses' to join discussion related to expenses.

### Timing

You can send a request for reimbursement any time, however, beware that requests will be collated and submitted to the funding body once a month (usually, the last week of each month).
If the details you provide is incomplete we will get in touch with you for more information using the email address you provided. If you fail to provide information and/or the information you provide is erroneous, we reserve the rights not to reimburse your expenses. Therefore, please, take extra care when submitting a claim.
If no problems arise, the reimbursement will be issued within few weeks.
