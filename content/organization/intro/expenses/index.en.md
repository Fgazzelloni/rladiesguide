We do not want you to spend your personal money on your local chapter!

## Local sponsors

If you find a local sponsors, at the moment since there is no formal structure for receiving funds, it is best if the sponsor pays directly for a need of your chapter, like food at the next event or accomodation for a guest speaker.
The sponsor might also want to e.g. put a room at your disposal for free.

There is the option of paying from your own pocket and have the sponsor reimburse you but that is riskier.

We are piloting using [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) -- the results of the pilot are not in yet. 

### How to find sponsors?

You might try to cold email (i.e. reach out to, without knowing them) local IT companies you think might be interested in R-Ladies mission.

You might try to use your personal contacts such as current or past employers, and those of the members of the meetup who could ask their own employers to provide a room for meetups for instance.

You might also hear of special call for proposals of diversity initiatives where your chapter could apply. 

In all cases, it can help to tell the members of your chapter to be on the lookout and help you not miss opportunities.

If you cannot get an sponsor/grant and/or wish to discuss what type of expenses could be covered by the R-Ladies organisation, please contact the **finance team** (`finance@rladies.org`) **before making any expense**.

### How to submit expenses
