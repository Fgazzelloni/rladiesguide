## Account Admin  

The account admin (team) for the rotating curator account are members of the R-Ladies community who keep @WeAreRLadies running. The account admin could be a team of 1-4 people who can rotate responsibilities from month-to-month. Being an account admin is an opportunity to connect with R-Ladies from all over the world while facilitating an online community resource.     

## Primary Responsibilities  

The responsibilities of the account admin are to:  
* Coordinate and grant Twitter account access to curators.
* Provide instructions to curators and answer questions as needed.  
* Recruit R-Ladies to be curators for the account.  
* Update and expand on the below procedures as needed.   

## Admin Procedures  

### When someone signs up to curate:    
* Add them to the curator schedule as soon as possible so other potential curators know that week is unavailable.  
* The curator should send an email to WeAre@rladies.org with a photo for the account  
* When this photo is received, save it in the Curator Photos Folder.  
  - Save it as **YYYY-MM-DD-firstname** (date is first day of scheduled curation week)  
* Reply to the curator’s email confirming their schedule week for curating. You may use the template below:  

>Hi NAME,
>
>Thank you for the photo. You are scheduled to curate the week of DATE. We will contact you 1 week before you are scheduled to curate with more details. Let us know if you have any questions.   
>Thanks!


### 1 Week before they are scheduled to curate:  
* Create a draft of their infographic.  
* Send an email to the curator that includes:  
  - A reminder of when they are scheduled to curate;  
  - A draft of the infographic, request that they approve or request changes to the draft;  
  - Link the Curator Guide for their reference. Ask them if they have any questions.  

#### Sample email ~1 week before the first day of curating

>Hi **NAME**,
>
>We are excited to have you curate next week! You are scheduled to curate from Monday, **[DATE]** to Saturday **[DATE]**. Depending on your schedule, we can modify this slightly (i.e. start on Tuesday or end on Friday), just let us know. We appreciate your time and contributions to the R-Ladies RoCur!
>
>We’ve attached what we will post this Sunday to advertise your curation week. Please let us know any changes that you would like no later than **[DATE]**.
>
>Please read through our [Curator Guide](https://guide.rladies.org/rocur/guide/) in preparation for curating. Additionally, if you haven’t already, please join our R-Ladies Directory.
>
>We will contact you later this week with more information about accessing our Twitter account. In the meantime, let us know if you have any questions about curating.
>
>Thanks!


### Sunday before they are scheduled to curate:   
* Post their final infographic to the RoCur feed (be sure to mention their personal Twitter handle).  
* Add the curator’s twitter handle as a contributor on the RoCur account (via Tweetdeck) and remove last week’s curator from the RoCur team  
* Email the curator that they are now added to the Twitter account.  
* They will need to visit [tweetdeck.twitter.com](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) while logged into their twitter account in order to tweet from the account.  

#### Same email ~1-2 days before the first day of curating

>Hi NAME,
>
>We have added you as a contributor to the @WeAreRLadies account. While logged into twitter, visit: https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/ and you should see @WeAreRLadies under your “Accounts” (at the bottom left part of the menu). Twitter also has a tweetdeck guide that might be useful.  
>
>Please refer to our Curator Guide for our curator agreement and tips re: engaging with our Twitter audience. Your curatorship will start on Monday, at 7AM ET and end on Saturday, at 12PM ET.  
>
>If you have any questions or encounter any problem, you can send us an email at WeAre@rladies.org. Also, you can join our #rocur_twitter channel on the community slack where you can reach out to all RoCur Managers and get connected with past curators.  
>
>Thanks!  

## Recruiting Curators  

Account admin can recruit potential curators in a variety of ways:  
* The R-Ladies Community Slack;  
* Reaching out to organizers of different R-Ladies chapters   
* A general call on the @RLadiesGlobal or @WeAreRLadies Twitter handles  
* Individual outreach to specific R-Ladies community members you admire!  

In line with R-Ladies' mission, this account aims to spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert. Currently, we do not have a protocol for individuals to curate more than one time.  

We also aim for this rotating curator account to be a sustainable initiative. Therefore, there is no pressure for account admin to have curators lined up for every single week. Additionally, account admin are allowed to identify times during the calendar year for the account to go on hiatus (or a sustained period with no curators).
